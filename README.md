# CAR-BRAND-AND-MODEL-DETECTION

## Note: you need to download Project's dataset (train & test) to start the project.
## Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fcis-deep-learning-competition/data
## Image Classification based on the contextual data of the image. firstly we applied several data preprocessing and data ##augmentation.
## For example: cropping the cars using itâ€™s boundary boxes then applying many data augmentation techniques: Flipping with Fixed degrees ## Noise addition and Applying Grayscale to the images.
## After that we train differents models: using GoogleNet architecture and Pre-Trained VGG16 Model.
